Movie Ticketing System
This project aims to create a movie booking system that can be accessed by both customers and managers. The system will have two main functionalities: one for customers and one for managers.

For customers, the program will provide a user-friendly interface where they can check the available movies that are currently streaming. The system will display the movies along with their showtimes, allowing customers to choose a movie that matches their schedule. Once they have selected a movie, they can proceed to book their seats. The program will show a seating layout for the chosen movie, indicating which seats are available and which are already booked. After confirming their purchase, the program will update the seating availability accordingly. It will finally prompt the user to leave their review about their experience in using our system.

For managers, the program will provide administrative features. They will have access to a revenue collection function, which allows them to keep track of the total revenue generated. It will also provide an option to add and delete movies, update seat status for fresh start for the day, review customers suggestion to improve their services and manage the checking in to the movies.

Overall, this movie booking system provides a convenient platform for customers to check movie availability and book their seats, while also providing managers with tools to track revenue and manage the system on a daily basis.
